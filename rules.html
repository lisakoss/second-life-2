                    <h3>factors</h3>
                    <p><strong>Human factors:</strong> Each team will receive a shared Google document of the rules and there will also be a rule billboard located on Social Island as a reminder. We will send out an email with the document shortly before teams participate in our gamified tasks and ask each team to reply to confirm that they received them and fully understand the rules. To ensure there are no questions, we will also explain the rules on the night of the performance to clear up any confusion.</p>
                    <p>If anyone has any questions or confusion during the actual completion of the tasks, they can ask Kairi for support. If the teams are making mistakes during the tasks, one of the team members from Second Life 2.0 will point out the mistake and help correct them, as long as it does not violate any of the following rules. </p>
                        
                    <p><strong>Programming factors:</strong> Our <em><strong>dragon AI</strong></em> will also help answer questions as well based on specific keywords and will be controlled by Lisa, our dragon tamer. The dragon AI follows Lisa's avatar around specifically, but will attempt to answer any questions typed into the global Second Life chat to the best of it's ability by providing hints based on the question keywords. If the AI fails to give valuable hints at any time during the game due to lack of needed keywords or any misunderstandings, our dragon tamer can help coax the dragon into giving the wondering teams some answers to their questions.This dragon will also give warnings if any team is found to be close to breaking any rules.</p>
                   
                   <h3>the list of rules</h3>

                        <li>For each team member that completes a task for their team, they <em><strong>must</strong></em> enter the following in the Sococo chat to let us know that they have completed the task: 
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Name of Team</em></li>

                        <li>In every task, two teams that have taken the most time or have not completed the task within the time limit will be eliminated before the next task starts.</li>
