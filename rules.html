                   <h3>the list of rules</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Do not purposely wander when your team is instructed to follow a specific patronus (group leader) during task 1 or are instructed to meet at a specific building for task 2.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>if you get lost, ask for help in Sococochat  so your group leader can find you.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>For each task that is completed, you must type in the Sococo chat your abbreviated team's name and keyword. Teams should also communicate with their respective team members via Sococo while gathering the three horcruxes for task 3. For example, a team member of Gryffindor might say: GR found teleport OR GR sword.</li>
                        <li>Your team may not collect more than one (1) Gryffindor sword, one (1) Slytherin gold necklace, or one (1) of Tom Riddle's diary or your team will face penalties.</li>
                        <li>When turning in the items to the Godess, your entire team must be present at the table before placing the three (3) horcruxes down on the table (MUST be placed on table, not floor or elsewhere). If your entire team is not present when placing the items down, your team will face penalties.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>consequences of breaking any game rule</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If a team or team member is found purposely wandering during task 1 or task 2 and they do not ask for help from their leader if they get lost, they will be disqualified from participating in the rest of the tasks. Every team must stay focused on the tasks in order to help ensure that our tour runs smoothly.</li>
                        <li>If a team has intentionally collected more than one Gryffindor sword, Slytherin gold necklace, or Tom Riddle diary, the team will be disqualified from participating in the rest of the tasks. This is to ensure that each team has a fair chance of finding their own set of three horcruxes.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>factors</h3>
                    <p><strong>Human factors:</strong> Each team will receive a shared Google document of the rules and there will also be a rule billboard located on Social Island as a reminder. We will send out an email with the document shortly before teams participate in our gamified tasks and ask each team to reply to confirm that they received them and fully understand the rules. To ensure there are no questions, we will also explain the rules on the night of the performance to clear up any confusion.</p>
                    <p>If anyone has any questions or confusion during the actual completion of the tasks, they can ask Kairi for support. If the teams are making mistakes during the tasks, one of the team members from Second Life 2.0 will point out the mistake and help correct them, as long as it does not violate any of the following rules. </p>
                        
                    <p><strong>Programming factors:</strong> Our <em><strong>dragon AI</strong></em> will also help answer questions as well based on specific keywords and will be controlled by Lisa, our dragon tamer. The dragon AI follows Lisa's avatar around specifically, but will attempt to answer any questions typed into the global Second Life chat to the best of it's ability by providing hints based on the question keywords. If the AI fails to give valuable hints at any time during the game due to lack of needed keywords or any misunderstandings, our dragon tamer can help coax the dragon into giving the wondering teams some answers to their questions.This dragon will also give warnings if any team is found to be close to breaking any rules.</p>
