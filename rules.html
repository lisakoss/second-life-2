                    <h1>// rules</h1>
                    <h3>the list of rules</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Do not purposely use your <strong>avatar</strong> to wander in our <strong>immersive environment</strong> within <strong>Second Life</strong> when your team is instructed to follow a specific Patronus (group leader) during task 1 and task 2. Use your <strong>field of view in-world</strong> to help keep your gaze fixed on your Patronus to ensure that you remain <strong>immersed</strong> within our <strong>environment</strong>.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If you get lost and don't know the location of your Patronus, ask for help in Sococo chat so your group leader can offer you a teleport to their location. This is a form of guided <strong>error recovery</strong> so you remain engaged in our tasks.</li>
                            </ul></br>
                        <li>For each task that is completed, you must type in the Sococo chat your abbreviated team's name and designated keyword. <strong>Teams</strong> should also communicate with their respective team members via Sococo while gathering the three horcruxes for task 3. </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For example, a team member of Gryffindor might say: GR found teleport OR GR sword.</li>
                            </ul></br>
                        <li>Your team may not collect more than one (1) Gryffindor sword, one (1) Slytherin gold necklace, or one (1) of Tom Riddle's diary (all are <strong>fantasy</strong> items that <strong>mimic</strong> a <strong>immersive</strong>, dystopian <strong>environment</strong> and go along with our <strong>storytelling</strong>) or your team will face penalties. </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>This means you must collaborate and <strong>mediate</strong> your actions within your team to avoid collecting duplicate horcruxes.</li>
                            </ul></br>
                        <li>When turning in the horcruxes to the Goddess, all the <strong>avatars</strong> on your entire team must be present before placing the three (3) horcruxes down at the <strong>virtual</strong> table to ensure <strong>spatial presence</strong> and total engagement of all team members or your team will face penalties. </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Communicate with your team members to receive <strong>feedback</strong> and use your <strong>field of view in-game</strong> to make sure the rest of your team members are beside you before you begin the turn in process. This should <strong>influence your thoughts and behavior</strong> when experiencing the <strong>gaming dynamics</strong> of task 3.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>consequences of breaking any game rule</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If a team or team member is found purposely wandering during task 1 or task 2 and they do not ask for help from their leader if they get lost, they will be disqualified from participating in the rest of our in world activities. Every team must stay focused on the tasks in order to help ensure that our tour runs smoothly.</li>
                        <li>If a team has intentionally collected more than one Gryffindor sword, Slytherin gold necklace, or Tom Riddle diary, the team will be disqualified from participating in the rest of the tasks. This is to ensure that each team has a fair chance of finding their own set of three horcruxes.</li>
                        <li>If you try to turn in any of the horcruxes without your entire team present, ten seconds will be added onto your final time for every item placed down without the presence of your entire team.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>enforcement</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For tasks one and two, the Patronus leaders (Alexis, Lisa, and Yong) will be keeping track of their respective teams they're leading. If they see any team members wandering intentionally, they will disqualify the team from participating in the remaining tasks.</li>
                        <li>Yong will be responsible for keeping track and ensuring that each team only has one of each horcrux. The rest of the team will also be monitoring team members to ensure any other rules are not broken as well.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>factors</h3>
                    <p><strong>Human factors:</strong> Each team will receive a <a href="https://kairihye.github.io/second-life-2.0/">simplified webpage</a> of the rules and there will also be a rule billboard located on Social Island as a reminder. We will send out an email with the webpage shortly before teams participate in our gamified tasks and ask each team to reply to confirm that they received them and fully understand the rules. To ensure there are no questions, we will also explain the rules on the night of the performance to clear up any confusion.</p>
                    <p>If anyone has any questions or confusion during the actual completion of the tasks, they can ask Kairi or any other team member for support. If the teams are making mistakes during the tasks, one of the team members from Second Life 2.0 will point out the mistake and help correct them, as long as it does not violate any of the following rules. </p>
                        
                    <p><strong>Programming factors:</strong> Our <em><strong>dragon AI</strong></em> will also help answer questions as well based on specific keywords and will be controlled by Lisa, our dragon tamer. The dragon AI follows Lisa's avatar around specifically, but will attempt to answer any questions typed into the global Second Life chat to the best of it's ability by providing hints based on the question keywords. If the AI fails to give valuable hints at any time during the game due to lack of needed keywords or any misunderstandings, our dragon tamer can help coax the dragon into giving the wondering teams some answers to their questions.This dragon will also give warnings if any team is found to be close to breaking any rules.</p>
