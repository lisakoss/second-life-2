				<h3>03/08/17 @ 8 P.M. - 10 P.M.</h3>
				<p>During our final meeting before the tours, we revamped some of our rules and tasks in order to be more inclusive of all students within i466. As a result, some of our team members' roles changed and we also made the tasks easier so everyone could easily particpate in the time limit given for each task. Additionally, we decided to make a PowerPoint to go along with our presentation in order to allow the other teams to follow along with us as well as working on our final tour script for tomorrow night. We also updated our website to reflect all of these changes and added a simplified rule page to be used the night of our tour. </p>

				<h3>02/26/17 @ 12 P.M. - 2 P.M.</h3>
				<p>In one of our final meetings for the quarter, we furthered defined our task metrics to clearly state what is expected of each team and what will get a team eliminated during the tour of our skybox. We also added a new elimination system that can potentially eliminate up to two teams from the competition if they do not complete a specific task within the allotted time frame. Each team member's role has also been finalized and the outline for communication between us and our teams has been completed as well. </p>

				<h3>02/20/17 @ 11 A.M. - 1 P.M.</h3>
				<p>Our third meeting is where we discussed where to place the teleport to our skybox on social island. After finding a good (and very well hidden) location, we also went on to discuss how we wanted to enforce the rules while teams were performing our tasks. We also finalized how we would know that teams understood the rules prior to even beginning the tasks as well. To help enforce our rules, we discussed the violations that would get a team removed from the game.</p>

                <h3>02/12/17 @ 7-9 P.M.</h3>
				<p>This week we discussed our plans for our skybox and began searching the Second Life Marketplace for items to fit our Tim Burton theme in-world. As a group, we found items such as pumpkins, haunted houses, and even an AI dragon! Alexis, Govind, Kairi and Yong spent most of the two hours decorating the skybox while Lisa worked to re-program the AI dragon to respond to new customized phrases and possibly help users if they get stuck while completing our tasks.</p>

				<p>We also went over ideas for our tasks and started to gather ideas for our story. By the assignment due date, we were able to create the three tasks we wanted other users to complete (find the portal to our realm, teleport to our realm, and then find our three horcruxes) and we also started to construct the story behind our alternate world. You may remember Gayle from our original island… well now she’s found herself in the after world and it’s your job to bring her back to life.</p>

				<p>The game we created for our users is simple: it’s a scavenger hunt. Not only do they have to find our skybox, but they have to figure out how to teleport into it. Once that’s completed, each team will have to work together to find the three horcruxes (metal sword, gold necklace, and Tom Riddle’s diary) that we hid throughout the structures in our skybox. If you think this is an easy search… you better think again. Our world is scary and it’s dark, it’s definitely no walk in the park. You’ll have to think outside of the box if your team plans to find each one of our items within the time allotted to you.</p>

				<p>We are still currently modifying our island with more decorations and refining our tasks to make sure there’s nothing unclear in the scavenger hunt we have planned for the rest of our class.</p>

				<h3>02/08/17 @ 5-7 P.M.</h3>
				<p>During our first meeting, we decided on the theme we wanted to pursue for our Second Life 2.0 team. Since we decided to stay in Second Life, we wanted to create something that would be different than what we’ve done so far this quarter.</p>

				<p>We all agreed upon the idea of having our skybox follow a theme of “Tim Burton” so we wanted to include elements from some of he has directed movies, such as the <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em> and <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. To help add more elements in addition to those, we sort of stuck with a Halloween theme as well to ensure we will have enough decorations to furnish all of our structures.</p>

				<p>We also broke up all the tasks for the week among each group member. Lisa and Alexis are responsible for the creation and management of the website and writing up background information on VR and Second Life while Govind, Kairi, Kevin, and Yong are responsible for starting to create ideas for our three tasks and storyline. Each one of us also filled out an ‘about me’ to put up on our website.</p>

				<p>Additionally, we all started to look for potential items to buy on the Second Life Marketplace that we wanted to put in our skybox while also discussing about what form we wanted our AI to be. We thought about making it a dog, but then Lisa came up with the idea of having our AI element to be a dragon instead, to help fit within our theme.</p>
