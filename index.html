						<h3>...second life?</h3>
						<p>Second Life is an online virtual world that was launched by Linden Lab in 2003. Any registered user can represent themselves through a virtual avatar while also exploring the world socializing with other avatars and even interacting with the environment by building. Your virtual avatar is able to participate in task-based games and can modify the world around you to fit whatever vision you might have.</p>

						<p>The Founder, Philip Rosedale, initially formed Linden Lab with the intentions of creating computer hardware that would allow you to be immersed into a virtual world, but eventually that idea changed into a software application of Second Life. The earliest software prototype that was engineered was known as “The Rig” and was worn on your shoulders to help immerse you into the environment you were interacting with.</p>

						<p>By 2005, Second Life garnered a lot of media attention and saw an exponential growth in its regular user base with an estimation of 600,000 regularly active accounts.</p>

						<h3>...immersive environments?</h3>
						<p>As early the late 1950s, Morton Heilig introduced immersive environments to the general public. Heilig created the first multisensory virtual experience in a product called the Sensorama that diminished sensory input from the world around the user. It enclosed the user and replaced their senses with different media that included objects such as film, sound, vibration, wind, or even odor. Before computers were even invented, VR type technologies were already in existence. It is evident humans already had an innate curiosity before the creation of modern day technology to experience things in new ways in different types of realities.</p>

						<p>In one of the first virtual worlds, Worlds Chat, new users did not yet understand the social norms for these kinds of simulations (such as, is it okay to walk through another avatar). Due to this never before seen technology, many users felt like they had to follow the social norms of the real world because they didn’t know anything different. However, the communities of virtual worlds would develop their own social norms, determining what is acceptable behavior and what is not.</p>

						<p>Today, immersive environments are all around you, whether it’s an online application accessed through your browser, an application you play through your gaming console, or through the use of a virtual reality headset, humans are immersed into other environments that are not their own on a daily basis.</p>

I’m a third year student who is currently majoring in Informatics. I aspire to be a web developer in the future with plans to permanently call Seattle my home. Some fun facts about me is that I love going to concerts (pop punk bands are my favorite) and I love taking photos whenever I get the chance.

								<strong>Tour Role</strong></br>I will be roaming around the alternate world island while the teams are attempting to complete the last task of finding the three, real horcruxes. Around our skybox, we have hidden real horcruxes… and ones resembling the horcruxes the teams are searching for. The teams must decide which ones are real and which ones aren’t and turn them into me, the Goddess. Once a team collects all three items from around our skybox, I will mark the team’s completion time into our table keeping tabs on times (metrics) to help determine the winner.

The dragon AI follows my avatar around specifically, but will attempt to answer any questions typed into the global Second Life chat to the best of it's ability by providing hints based on the question keywords. If the AI fails to give valuable hints at any time during the game due to lack of needed keywords or any misunderstandings, I can help coax the dragon into giving the wondering teams some answers to their questions.This dragon will also give warnings if any team is found to be close to breaking any rules.

				<h1>// the story</h1>
				<h2>...what are we doing?</h2>
				<img class="story-img" src="css/img/story1.png" alt="story" width="450px" />
				<p>It has been a few weeks since Gayle’s arrival and the residents of Social Island have began to leave for expeditions. Some residents decided to explore the skies and are building an island somewhere in the unexplored atmosphere. A handful of residents are exploring the land of Penguins, Minecraft, Space, and virtual reality. However, a few residents, including our team, have decided to stick around Second Life’s Social Island.</p>	

				<p>One day while everyone was up and roaming around the island, Gayle decided to go scuba diving and was unfortunately <strong>engulfed by the lagoon</strong> (at least, that’s what we think). The same day, the SL 2.0 family decided to go find Gayle and invite her to dinner… but she was nowhere to be found. Looking around for Gayle, they happen upon a sign, indicating that all of the Social Island residents must immediately return home in order to conduct a island wide search for Gayle.</p>

				<p>The SL 2.0 team immediately reached out to all residents who are currently on their expeditions to return home at once to Social Island to help rescue Gayle from her deathly peril. It seems like she’s found her way to the <em>afterlife</em> and it’s our responsibility to bring her back to life.</p>

				<p>But first, how are we going to get there? Where is Gayle exactly? Is her soul wandering around lost... in the underworld? What do the residents have to do to bring her back to life?</p>
				
				<p>It is up to the other residents to gather together in search of the access point to the underworld and figure out exactly how they will be able to enter it. They must then complete an extensive search within the afterlife for her lost soul by following clues (...there’s a myth about a small, underworld dragon that might be able to lend some hints…) so they can bring her home.</p>

				<h1>// the tasks</h1>
				<h2>...what's our plan?</h2>
				<p>As a team, our objective is to modify the current INFO 466 island on Second Life. To do this, we have proposed to introduce our new changes within a Skybox as a way to minimize the loading times experienced due to all of the content everyone has already added to the island. Within our Skybox, we are introducing a new theme of Tim Burton as well to create a sense of the 'afterlife' that goes along with the topic of our story.</p>
					
				<p>We will also be adding artificial intelligence to our island in the form of a dragon. More details will come later.</p>
			
				<h2 class="met">our task metrics</h2>
				<p>Our team's slack channel is where we keep track of each team member's weekly task and their current progress on completing it. Since our objectives change each week based on the current homework assignment, each team member is assigned a weekly task. We split up the tasks among our team members according to their skills and set approriate deadlines to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to complete the needed objectives each week.</p>

				<p>Check under <a href="update.html">weekly updates</a> to view our current collaborative homework document. It includes all of the information we are working on for the week that will be submitted at the assignment's deadline.</p>

				<h2>team management</h2>
				<p>At the moment, the teams will consistent of their current collaborative team, but their team names will instead be the houses from Hogwarts and two sectors from Lord of the Rings. We ideally want all students in the class to be able to participate in our scavenger hunt.</p>
