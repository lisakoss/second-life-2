						<h3>...second life?</h3>
						<p>Second Life is an online virtual world that was launched by Linden Lab in 2003. Any registered user can represent themselves through a virtual avatar while also exploring the world socializing with other avatars and even interacting with the environment by building. Your virtual avatar is able to participate in task-based games and can modify the world around you to fit whatever vision you might have.</p>

						<p>The Founder, Philip Rosedale, initially formed Linden Lab with the intentions of creating computer hardware that would allow you to be immersed into a virtual world, but eventually that idea changed into a software application of Second Life. The earliest software prototype that was engineered was known as “The Rig” and was worn on your shoulders to help immerse you into the environment you were interacting with.</p>

						<p>By 2005, Second Life garnered a lot of media attention and saw an exponential growth in its regular user base with an estimation of 600,000 regularly active accounts.</p>

						<h3>...immersive environments?</h3>
						<p>As early the late 1950s, Morton Heilig introduced immersive environments to the general public. Heilig created the first multisensory virtual experience in a product called the Sensorama that diminished sensory input from the world around the user. It enclosed the user and replaced their senses with different media that included objects such as film, sound, vibration, wind, or even odor. Before computers were even invented, VR type technologies were already in existence. It is evident humans already had an innate curiosity before the creation of modern day technology to experience things in new ways in different types of realities.</p>

						<p>In one of the first virtual worlds, Worlds Chat, new users did not yet understand the social norms for these kinds of simulations (such as, is it okay to walk through another avatar). Due to this never before seen technology, many users felt like they had to follow the social norms of the real world because they didn’t know anything different. However, the communities of virtual worlds would develop their own social norms, determining what is acceptable behavior and what is not.</p>

						<p>Today, immersive environments are all around you, whether it’s an online application accessed through your browser, an application you play through your gaming console, or through the use of a virtual reality headset, humans are immersed into other environments that are not their own on a daily basis.</p>

					<h2>branding</h2>
					<p class="brand">Our color for our website include shades of a light blue along with shades of grays which are also represented in our world of Second Life. We followed the color scheme given to us (blue/gray), which worked well for our dark, somewhat scary theme representing Tim Burton’s style of films. Our branded image, which represents a dark version of our once bright Social Island, is represented throughout both our website and 3D virtual world. We have taken various shades of dark grays and blacks represented in our website and found structures, decorations, and a ground color that incorporated blacks, grays, and blues in them along with choosing to build a dark, run down tree house (which represents Ran’s house on Social Island) to help tie our dark and terrifying theme of the afterlife together with the original Social Island.</p>

				<h1>// the story</h1>
				<h2>...what are we doing?</h2>
				<img class="story-img" src="css/img/story1.png" alt="story" width="450px" />
				<p>It has been a few weeks since Gayle’s arrival and the residents of Social Island have began to leave for expeditions. Some residents decided to explore the skies and are building an island somewhere in the unexplored atmosphere. A handful of residents are exploring the land of Penguins, Minecraft, Space, and virtual reality. However, a few residents, including our team, have decided to stick around Second Life’s Social Island.</p>	

				<p>One day while everyone was up and roaming around the island, Gayle decided to go scuba diving and was unfortunately <strong>engulfed by the lagoon</strong> (at least, that’s what we think). The same day, the SL 2.0 family decided to go find Gayle and invite her to dinner… but she was nowhere to be found. Looking around for Gayle, they happen upon a sign, indicating that all of the Social Island residents must immediately return home in order to conduct a island wide search for Gayle.</p>

				<p>The SL 2.0 team immediately reached out to all residents who are currently on their expeditions to return home at once to Social Island to help rescue Gayle from her deathly peril. It seems like she’s found her way to the <em>afterlife</em> and it’s our responsibility to bring her back to life.</p>

				<p>But first, how are we going to get there? Where is Gayle exactly? Is her soul wandering around lost... in the underworld? What do the residents have to do to bring her back to life?</p>
				
				<p>It is up to the other residents to gather together in search of the access point to the underworld and figure out exactly how they will be able to enter it. They must then complete an extensive search within the afterlife for her lost soul by following clues (...there’s a myth about a small, underworld dragon that might be able to lend some hints…) so they can bring her home.</p>

				<h1>// the tasks</h1>
				<h2>...what's our plan?</h2>

				<p>As a team, our objective is to modify the current INFO 466 island on Second Life. To do this, we have proposed to introduce our new changes within a Skybox as a way to minimize the loading times experienced due to all of the content everyone has already added to the island. Within our Skybox, we are introducing a new theme of Tim Burton as well to create a sense of the 'afterlife' that goes along with the topic of our story in the search of Gayle.</p>
					
				<p>We also added artificial intelligence to our skybox in the form of a dragon. This dragon will help teams complete our last task by providing hints when necessary with the help of our dragon tamer. For example, this dragon will give out the horcrux locations when teams interact with it by typing certain keywords so they can find the items faster during our last task.</p>

				<p>Our team's slack channel is where we keep track of each team member's weekly task and their current progress on completing it. Since our objectives change each week based on the current homework assignment, each team member is assigned a weekly task. We split up the tasks among our team members according to their skills and set appropriate deadlines to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to complete the needed objectives each week.</p>

				<p>Check under <a href="update.html">weekly updates</a> to view our current collaborative homework document. It includes all of the information we are working on for the week that will be submitted at the assignment's deadline.</p>

				<h2 class="met">Parallel Communication</h2>
				<p><strong>Before the tour</strong> commences, Kairi will provide the SLURL to the starting location for our tour. Govind will then tell the continuation of Social Island’s original story via Sococo voice chat to get the teams up to date on the context of our tour and the platform it will be located on (Second Life). Kairi, our director, will also be communicating with the teams over voice briefly about the sort of tasks the teams will be completing.</p>
				
				<p><strong>During the tour</strong> Kairi will keep teams engaged by interacting with them during our tour. She will be directing our tour and moving us from task to task. She will also be explaining the specifics of each task (noting the objective and respective reward). Kevin will be responsible for starting each task, marking the start time and end time in Sococo chat, and will record completion times for each team. Lisa and Yong will be giving out clues with the help of the AI dragon while the teams are completing task three and Alexis will be responsible for instructing the teams to come find her to turn in the three horcruxes once they find them. Govind will be filming all of the tasks during the entirety of our tour. All team members will help keep watch for any rule breakers and will correct the teams when they need help or are making mistakes.</p>
				
				<p><strong>After the tour</strong>, Kairi will announce the winners and thank the teams for participating. Kairi will also send out the rewards for the winning teams of tasks one and two while Ran/Mano will be responsible for giving the winning team of the third task their 10 grade points. All winners will be notified through email also. <em>If</em> there is extra time remaining, we will give a brief tour and look at our skybox and the reasoning behind our theme/story.</p>
			
				<h2 class="met">task metrics & rewards</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Task One:</strong> record the how long each team takes to find the teleport to our alternate world to determine the fastest team</br>
					<strong>Task Two:</strong> record how long each team takes to get inside our skybox and find their respective Patronus to determine the fastest team.</br>
					<strong>Task Three:</strong> record how long each team takes to find the <strong>three (3)</strong> horcruxes and turn them in to determine the fastest team.</br>
				</p>
				
				<p>The <strong>metrics table</strong> will be filled out when the teams complete each task: <strong>C</strong> for <em>completion</em> or <strong>IC</strong> for <em>incomplete</em> along with the respective team's time. If a team gains a time penalty during task three, this will be indicated by an <strong>asterick *</strong> next to their completed time (to show that additional time has been added).</p>

							<p>Before starting this task, each team will be assigned to a Patronus who will act as their group leader, guiding them through the first two tasks.
