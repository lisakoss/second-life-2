						<h3>...second life?</h3>
						<p>Second Life is an online virtual world that was launched by Linden Lab in 2003. Any registered user can represent themselves through a virtual avatar while also exploring the world socializing with other avatars and even interacting with the environment by building. Your virtual avatar is able to participate in task-based games and can modify the world around you to fit whatever vision you might have.</p>

						<p>The Founder, Philip Rosedale, initially formed Linden Lab with the intentions of creating computer hardware that would allow you to be immersed into a virtual world, but eventually that idea changed into a software application of Second Life. The earliest software prototype that was engineered was known as “The Rig” and was worn on your shoulders to help immerse you into the environment you were interacting with.</p>

						<p>By 2005, Second Life garnered a lot of media attention and saw an exponential growth in its regular user base with an estimation of 600,000 regularly active accounts.</p>

						<h3>...immersive environments?</h3>
						<p>As early the late 1950s, Morton Heilig introduced immersive environments to the general public. Heilig created the first multisensory virtual experience in a product called the Sensorama that diminished sensory input from the world around the user. It enclosed the user and replaced their senses with different media that included objects such as film, sound, vibration, wind, or even odor. Before computers were even invented, VR type technologies were already in existence. It is evident humans already had an innate curiosity before the creation of modern day technology to experience things in new ways in different types of realities.</p>

						<p>In one of the first virtual worlds, Worlds Chat, new users did not yet understand the social norms for these kinds of simulations (such as, is it okay to walk through another avatar). Due to this never before seen technology, many users felt like they had to follow the social norms of the real world because they didn’t know anything different. However, the communities of virtual worlds would develop their own social norms, determining what is acceptable behavior and what is not.</p>

						<p>Today, immersive environments are all around you, whether it’s an online application accessed through your browser, an application you play through your gaming console, or through the use of a virtual reality headset, humans are immersed into other environments that are not their own on a daily basis.</p>

				<h2>...what are we doing?</h2>
				<img class="story-img" src="css/img/story1.png" alt="story" width="450px" />
				<p>It has been a few weeks since Gayle’s arrival and the residents of Social Island have began to leave for expeditions. Some residents decided to explore the skies and are building an island somewhere in the unexplored atmosphere. A handful of residents are exploring the land of Penguins, Minecraft, Space, and virtual reality. However, a few residents have decided to stick around Social Island.</p>

				<p>One day while everyone was up and roaming around the island, Gayle decided to go scuba diving and was unfortunately <strong>engulfed by the lagoon</strong>. (So, we think.) The same day, the SL 2.0 family decided to go find Gayle and invite her to dinner, except they found a sign indicating that all of the Social Island residents must return home immediately and enter a game to bring Gayle back from the <em>afterlife</em>.</p>

				<p>The SL 2.0 team immediately reached out to all residents who are on their expeditions to return at once to Social Island to help save Gayle from the underworld!</p>

				<h1>// the tasks</h1>
				<h2>...what's our plan?</h2>
				<p>As a team, our objective is to modify the current INFO 466 island on Second Life. To do this, we have proposed to introduce our new changes within a Skybox as a way to minimize the loading times experienced due to all of the content everyone has already added to the island. Within our Skybox, we are introducing a new theme of Tim Burton as well to create a sense of the 'afterlife' that goes along with the topic of our story.</p>
					
				<p>We will also be adding artificial intelligence to our island. More details will come later.</p>
			
				<h2 class="met">our task metrics</h2>
				<p>Our team's general <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AS_CB3plCAiMUSa2UViOOHCDPPIflmq1OMeqB02Ch28/edit#gid=0">collaboration workspace</a> is where we keep track of each team member's weekly task and their current progress on completing it. Since our objectives change each week based on the current homework assignment, so each team member is assigned a weekly task. We split up the tasks among our team members according to their skills and set approriate deadlines to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to complete the needed objectives each week.</p>

				<p>Check under <a href="update.html">weekly updates</a> to view our current collaborative homework document. It includes all of the information we are working on for the week that will be submitted at the assignment's deadline.</p>

				<h2>team management</h2>
				<p>At the moment, the teams will consistent of their current collaborative team, but their team names will instead be the houses from Hogwarts and two sectors from Lord of the Rings. We ideally want all students in the class to be able to participate in our scavenger hunt.</p>
				<img src="css/img/teams.png" />

				<h2 class="met">correcting teams</h2>
				<p>For time’s sake, we will give some hints for the last two minutes of each task to help them attempt to complete the current task they are working on. If a team fails at a particular task, we can either teleport them or take them out of the competition. However, this decision is still to be determined.</p>

							<p>Each team can take a look at the sign, located by the town center near the lagoon, that was left behind by an anonymous figure about Gayle’s disappearance.

							<p>Each team must work together and find the three different horcruxes that are hidden around the alternate realm in the structures that we have built. Keep in mind, each one of these horcruxes aren't an easy find! Think of every possible hiding place you can think of and look there! Who knows, there's a rumor
